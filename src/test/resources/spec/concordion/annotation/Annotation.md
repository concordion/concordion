# Annotations
    
## Before and After method hooks
    
The [before and after](BeforeAndAfterMethodHooks.md "c:run") annotations provide hooks to invoke fixture methods before or after an __example__, __specification__ or __suite__.

## Field scoping
    
The [ConcordionScoped](ConcordionScoped.md "c:run") annotation allows you to share fields across a specification when the field is expensive to initialise, for example a browser instance or database connection.
        
## Configuration
    
The [@ConcordionOptions](ConcordionOptions.md "c:run") annotation provides the ability to configure aspects of Concordion, including extensions to the supported Markdown syntax, and saving a copy of the source HTML for debug purposes. 
    
## Customise the specification
	
The [@ConcordionResources](ConcordionResources.html "c:run") annotation can be used to apply a new theme to your specifications, tweak the existing styling, or add new css, javascript, images, or other resources.

## Implementation Status

The [@ExpectedToFail and @Unimplemented](ImplementationStatus.html "c:run") annotations allow you to include Concordion specifications in the build before they have been fully implemented.
