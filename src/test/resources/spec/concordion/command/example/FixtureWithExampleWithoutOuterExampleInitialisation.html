<h1>Field initialisation in fixtures with examples, but nothing in the "outer" example</h1>

<p>Unlike the "Field initialisation in fixtures with examples" specification, this specification has no commands outside of the named examples.</p>

<div c:example="example1">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the first example and there is no "outer" example, the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getFieldInitialisationCounter()">1</span> times.</p>
</div>

<div c:example="example2">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the second example, the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getFieldInitialisationCounter()">2</span> times.</p>
</div>
