<h1>Hook Methods in Fixtures</h1>

<p>When running a specification without examples, the specification is run as a single "outer" example
 and the @BeforeExample and @AfterExample hook methods are called for this outer example.
</p>
<p>The @BeforeExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getBeforeExampleCounter()">1</span> time,
and the @AfterExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getAfterExampleCounter()">0</span> times.
</p>
