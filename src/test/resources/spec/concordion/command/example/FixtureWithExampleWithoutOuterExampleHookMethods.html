<h1>Hook Methods in fixtures with examples, but nothing in the "outer" example</h1>

<p>Unlike the "Hook Methods in fixtures with examples" specification, this specification has no commands outside of the named examples.</p>

<div c:example="example1">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the first example and there is no "outer" example, the @BeforeExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getBeforeExampleCounter()">1</span> time,
and the @AfterExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getAfterExampleCounter()">0</span> time.</p>
</div>

<div c:example="example2">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the second example, the @BeforeExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getBeforeExampleCounter()">2</span> times,
and the @AfterExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getAfterExampleCounter()">1</span> times.</p>
