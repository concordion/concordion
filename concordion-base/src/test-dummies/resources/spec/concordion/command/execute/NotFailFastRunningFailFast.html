    <h1>Fail Fast Running a Fail Fast Test</h1>

    This class does two things:
    <ol>
    	<li>Runs a test that is <a href="FailFastException.html" concordion:run="concordion">failing fast</a>.</li>
    	<li>Asserts some <span concordion:assertEquals="getSuccessString()">Success</span> that should happen  - even though the previous test failed fast due to an an exception,
            this test is not annotated @FailFast so it should continue.</li>
    </ol>
