<h1>Field initialisation in fixtures with examples</h1>

<p>When running a specification with examples, a new fixture object is created for each example, including the outer (anonymous) example, if there is one.</p>
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the outer example (ie. outside of the named examples), 
the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getFieldInitialisationCounter()">1</span> time.</p>

<div c:example="before">
    <p>A before method shouldn't affect anything</p>
</div>

<div c:example="example1">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the first example, the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getFieldInitialisationCounter()">2</span> times.</p>
</div>

<div c:example="example2">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the second example, the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getFieldInitialisationCounter()">3</span> times.</p>
</div>

<p>Since this part of the specification is in the outer example, it is executed before the named examples above,
the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getFieldInitialisationCounter()">1</span> time.</p>
