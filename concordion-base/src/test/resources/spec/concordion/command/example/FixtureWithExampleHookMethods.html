<h1>Hook methods in fixtures with examples</h1>

<p>Since this part of the specification is in the outer example (ie. outside of the named examples)
 and the @BeforeExample and @AfterExample hook methods are called for the outer example,
the @BeforeExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getBeforeExampleCounter()">1</span> time and 
the @AfterExample methods called <span c:assertEquals="getAfterExampleCounter()">0</span> times.</p>

<div c:example="example1">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the first example,
the @BeforeExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getBeforeExampleCounter()">2</span> times and 
the @AfterExample methods called <span c:assertEquals="getAfterExampleCounter()">1</span> time.</p>
</div>

<div c:example="example2">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the second example, 
the @BeforeExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getBeforeExampleCounter()">3</span> times and 
the @AfterExample methods called <span c:assertEquals="getAfterExampleCounter()">2</span> times.</p>
</div>

<p>Since this part of the specification is in the outer example, it is executed before the named examples above, 
the @BeforeExample methods should have been called <span c:assertEquals="getBeforeExampleCounter()">1</span> time and 
the @AfterExample methods called <span c:assertEquals="getAfterExampleCounter()">0</span> times.</p>
