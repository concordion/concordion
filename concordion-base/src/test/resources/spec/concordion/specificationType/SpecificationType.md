# Specification Types

The canonical format for Concordion specifications is [HTML](html/Html.md "c:run"). 

As an alternative, [Markdown](markdown/Markdown.md "c:run") provides an easy-to-read and easy-to-write syntax for specifications. 

The extension mechanism allows you to plug in parsers for other formats, by implementing a converter to HTML. See the [Excel extension](https://github.com/concordion/concordion-excel-extension) for an example.
