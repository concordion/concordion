[Concordion](http://www.concordion.org) is an open source runner for executable specifications that creates rich living documentation.

Users should see the [Concordion](http://www.concordion.org) web site for details of how to download and use Concordion.

This README covers information for people wanting to work with the Concordion Java source code. 
Unmaintained versions of Concordion are also available for other languages, but not with the full feature set. 
See [Concordion.NET](https://github.com/concordion/concordion.net), [pyconcordion](https://pypi.org/project/pyconcordion2/) and [ruby-concordion](https://github.com/arielvalentin/ruby-concordion).

# Target Java version
Concordion currently targets Java 8 and above.

# Building Concordion
Concordion uses [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) as a build tool. The code base includes the Gradle Wrapper, which will automatically download the correct version of Gradle.

From the command line, run `gradlew tasks` to show available tasks. 

Note: If the current directory is not on your path, you will need to use `./gradlew tasks` on Unix-based systems, or `.\gradlew tasks` on Windows.

## Compiling and Running the Tests

The `test` task runs both the Concordion specification tests and unit tests. 
Since Concordion supports both JUnit Vintage and JUnit Jupiter, the tests can run with either version of JUnit.  

To run the tests with JUnit Jupiter, run the following from the command line:

```gradlew clean test```

To run the tests with JUnit Vintage, run the following from the command line:

```gradlew clean testVintage```

This will download the required dependencies, clean the existing project, recompile all source code and run all the tests. 
The Concordion specification output is written to the `./build/reports/spec` folder.

### Pre-processor
To switch between the JUnit Jupiter and Vintage tests, Concordion uses the [Manifold](http://manifold.systems/) preprocessor. 

For example:

```
#if JUNIT_VINTAGE
@RunWith(ConcordionRunner.class)
#else
@ConcordionFixture
#endif
```

The `JUNIT_VINTAGE` compiler argument is set by the `testVintage` Gradle task.

## Creating a jar file

Run the following from the command line:

```gradlew clean jar```

The jar file is written to the `./build/libs` folder.

## Installing a jar file into your local Maven repository

Installing a Concordion jar file into your local Maven repository makes it available to other projects that are using Maven or Gradle to manage their dependencies.

Run the following from the command line:

```gradlew pTML```

(where pTML is short for publishToMavenLocal).

### Using the Concordion jar file from your local Maven repository in a Gradle project

In order to use the local Maven repository in a Gradle project, you must add `mavenLocal()` to your `repositories` block. You can add this to the project's build.gradle script, or set it globally by adding the following to your ~/.gradle/init.gradle script:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
}
```

You will then need to ensure that your project's build.gradle script refers to the version you have in your local Maven repository, for example your dependencies might include:

    org.concordion:concordion:2.0.0-SNAPSHOT

or

    org.concordion:concordion:+

for the latest version.

# Importing the project into your IDE
Dependent on the version of your IDE, you may need to install a Gradle plugin to your IDE before importing the project. See [Gradle tooling](https://www.gradle.org/tooling) for details.

On importing the project to your IDE, the required dependencies will be downloaded.

For IntelliJ IDEA, installing the [Manifold plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10057-manifold) will enable
IntelliJ to recognise the Manifold preprocessor syntax.
